# Lab 1: Web Application Development

## Framework choice

The framework used for this app is **Flask**: 
It is relatively easy to use and does not require any additional modules, wich is perfect for small apps like this.


## Best practices applied

1. **Code Organization**
    - Separated application logic into modules to maintain clarity and scalability.
    - Followed a clean directory structure with clearly named files.

2. **PEP 8 Compliance:**
   - Used tools like `flake8` to ensure adherence to PEP 8 standards.
   - Indented properly, named variables meaningfully.

3. **Performance Optimization:**
    - Used efficient libraries for time and date manipulation (e.g., `pytz`).
    - Minimized unnecessary computation and reduced the app's response time.
